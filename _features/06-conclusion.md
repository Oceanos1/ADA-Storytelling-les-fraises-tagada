In this notebook, we have started gathering some information on how natives of a country treat their friends. We have seen how sociable are inhabitants of different countries, we have identified the places of interest where people hang out the most and finally <s>for people who like spying on others</s> making nice surprises, we have established a basic model to predict movements of users. <br>
We managed to put into light some cultural differences (we have been surprised to see that the behaviours of Japanese users is very different from the behaviour of any other type of users) and some similitudes (people check-in at their houses mainly at the end of the day and some POIs are very popular among a lot of different countries like malls or offices). However, we stay very frustrated : our subject is very vast and we didn't have the time to do a real comparaison. Each country would have deserved its own datastory and its whole sets of cultural explanations to justify each data. Moreover, we studied only 2013 and we still have data for 2012 and 2014, leaving space for much improvement. <br>
We realize that our subject was too ambitious for the time we had... <br>
Trying to fing meaningful results from new data was a very frightening task. We didn't know where to focus at first and ultimately used a lot of time trying to find where to go next furthermore, we had no way of checking if our results were true or false. Working on this project was also exhilarating. Finding new information and looking for explanations was very amusing and rewarding. Each time we found something, we would be thinking on what to do next.
