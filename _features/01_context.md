Do you yourself the soul of a traveler but loneliness scares you ? Are you scared of standing out like a sore thumb ? Where can you find friends ? Where should you meet with your newly found friends ? How do natives behave ?<br>

We want to find concrete answers to these practical questions in order to avoid any akward situation. In this data story, we will study 10 countries.<br>

In our work, we base our conclusions from the datasets “Global-scale Check-in Dataset with User Social Networks” from [two research projects](https://sites.google.com/site/yangdingqi/home/foursquare-dataset#h.p_7rmPjnwFGIx9) (project 5 by Dingqi Yang). The dataset is coming from *Foursquare* and it contains the information of **22,809,624 checkins** by **114,324 users**, **607,333 friendship links** and **3,820,891 POIs**. It contains a set of worldwide check-ins with country flags. All the checkins were taken over about two years. We also have two snapshots of the corresponding friendship links between users of the social network before (in Mar. 2012) and after (in May 2014) the check-in data collection period.<br>
Since there are too much data for one single data story, we decide to focus on 10 countries : the USA (1187597 checkins in 2013), Japan (1147469 checkins), Brazil (1003438), India (771871), Malaysia (606248), Turkey (601302), Mexico (477855), Thailand (339861) and the Phillipines (244149). We chose these countries because they have the most checkins.<br>

Our first step was to extract these subdatasets and to put them in the adequate format. For more details on this, we invite you to check our github [How to behave in uncharted territories](https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2020-project-milestone-p3-p3_les-fraises-tagada/blob/master/How%20to%20behave%20in%20foreign%20territoy%20%3F.ipynb).<br>

Now it is time to go on a wonderful journey through the world of data in order to seek for answers !
