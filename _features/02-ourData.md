In the paper, "Friendship and mobility : User movement in Location-Based Social Networks", the authors answered one important question : what influence do friends have on movements ?
But what if you don't have friends in the first place and just want to blend in ? Imagine : You just arrived in a new country. You don't know how to behave with the locals and what to expect. How friendly are people ? How often is it socially acceptable to meet ? Where should you meet ? Where and when should you go on holidays ?
In this storytelling, we will attempt to answer some of these questions for multiple countries.
