You have just set foot on new land. Let's make friends with natives !

We decided first to work on the USA country before working on all other smaller datasets.

We notice that our distribution plot is very similar to the one we obtained with the datasets from Gowalla and Brightkite. This result intuitively makes sense, since we  work on the same country. The only different parameter is the year of study (and it shouldn't impact much our results, people don't move a lot overall).


<br>
<h1> Then we now look at results using datasets from different countries<h1/>

 <h3>If you go to the US, natives have on average 6.26 friends in the new dataset (2013), our 90% confidence interval is [4.918, 7.82]<h3/>

There is also a difference of 2 friends between the median and the mean in the new dataset (2013).
 In the US, most users don't have many friends on Foursquare. There are a few "super users" which have a lot of friends !   
 
We notice that the number seems to have grown over time, but not by a lot.

On average, in Japan, natives have more friend than the US : 6.95 friends in 2013, our 90% confidence interval is [5.11, 8.72]

There is also a difference of 3 friends between the median and the mean in the new dataset (2013).
<br>
This means that contrary to the US, Japan have more "super users" !

 Also the number of "super user" and number of friend increase in time ! This can be explained by a greater use of Foursquare in Japan. The network is created in the US and perhaphs in the Japan, in this year, more people have created their account. Indeed the more the network is known the more friends you have on it.
