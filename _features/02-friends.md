You have just set foot on new land. Let's make friends with natives !

We decided first to work on the USA country before working on all other smaller datasets.

We notice that our distribution plot is very similar to the one we obtained with the datasets from Gowalla and Brightkite. This result intuitively makes sense, since we  work on the same country. The only different parameter is the year of study (and it shouldn't impact much our results, people don't move a lot overall).

 Then we now look at results using datasets from different countries

 <table>
  <tr>
    <td>First Screen Page</td>
     <td>Holiday Mention</td>
     <td>Present day in </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

 If you go to the US, natives have on average 6.26 friends, our 90% confidence interval is[ 4.918, 7.82]

 In the US, most users don't have many friends on Foursquare. There are a few "super users" which have a lot of friends !   
We notice that the number seems to have grown over time, but not by a lot.

On average, in Japan, natives have more friend than the US : 6.95 friends, our 90% confidence interval is[ 5.11, 8.72]

But contrary to the Us JP have more "super users" ! Also the number of "super user increase in time !
